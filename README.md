# capitali-browser
A simple browser written in C# with CefSharp that allows you to browse old websites from 1996 to 2005. (you can change the website to whatever you want from Form1.cs)

Build in Release mode.

Note: I know there is already a desktop client made for this , but this is just as a test.
